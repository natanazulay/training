Instinctively, Cindy swept everything off the table, threw herself on it in a fit of lust, and begged Chuck to ravish her. After Chuck finished his beer, he obliged her. When Chuck's magnificent lead sperm cannoned into Cindy's womb it went straight to one of her ovaries and roared, \"Which one of you servile wenches thinks you can handle getting split open by the Chuck!?\" All of the eggs cowered in the corner. The same thing happened at the other ovary. \"I didn't fucking think so!\" shouted the lead sperm which then lead the rest of the troops back into Chuck's balls. Chuck pulled out; roundhouse kicked Cindy in the face and told her, \"Don't ever waste my time again.\""

He then proceeded to rape the mugger anally, crush his skull, break his spine and killed him in a fraction of a second. Chuck Norris then brought the mugger back to life and then broke each of his limbs, eviscerated the mugger's gut, ate the mugger's still beating heart and infected him with AIDS, killing the unfortunate mugger once again. Chuck Norris then brough the mugger to life yet again for the second time, only to give the mugger a final fatal roundhous kick to his face killing the man and his soul at the same time. Chuck Norris then threw his packed wallet at the remains of his victim and said \"Do not tap on my shoulders ever again\", and continued to walk home slowly."
